# Hello-World
This is my first public repository! I am learning how to use GitHub.

I just started learning python a couple weeks ago and it has been challenging, but so much fun.

I am a junior at The University of Iowa majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems and I am also doing a minor in philosophy.

I have a dog named Scout and she's a golden doodle. I miss her so much when I'm away at school.

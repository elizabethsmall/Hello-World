# Hello-World
This is my first public repository! I am learning how to use GitHub.

## A little bit about me

I just started learning python a couple weeks ago and it has been *challenging*, but **so much fun.**
~~sometimes it's actually really really hard~~
**SO MUCH FUN**

I am a junior at The University of Iowa majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems and I am also doing a minor in philosophy.

I have a dog named Scout and she's a golden doodle. I miss her so much when I'm away at school.
